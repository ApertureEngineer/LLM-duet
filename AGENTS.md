# AGENTS

This repository hosts small utilities for making two language models talk to
each other. When modifying code here:

- Prefer clear docstrings and type hints for all functions.
- Run `python -m py_compile` on the modified Python files before committing.
- Keep line lengths to 100 characters or fewer.

These guidelines apply to all files in this repository.
